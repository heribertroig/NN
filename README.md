# NN
Here there will be my tasks in Neural Networks.

## Task 1
The aim of this task is to predict breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) estrogen receptor status using a Neural Network with Stacked Auto-Encoders (SAE). Data is partitioned in 5 zip files since the original compressed file is larger than 25 MB.
